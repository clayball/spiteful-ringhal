The motivation for this project is to include a backend process for comparing
the attacks identified by OSSEC, or some other IDS system, with publicly
available blacklists. Result data, e.g. the following 20 IP addresses
attacking us are on blacklists, can be used to generate stats that we can
report on in our SIEM. One goal is for this project to be SIEM neutral.
